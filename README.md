This repository shows proficency in computer networking through some small python applications.

The first program check weather a host is reachable through the network using udp sockets in python

The second program utilizes the raw socket functionality of the BSD socket layer library in python to capture wifi packets passively.

The third program is a udp based peer to peer chat application and it consits of two parts. the fist part runs in the back ground and is responsible for relaying messages to their intended destinations. The second part is a simple client program which can read message history and send messages. As of now, the program relies on trusting its users and doesn't have any message encryption or user authentification system. It is a work in progress.
